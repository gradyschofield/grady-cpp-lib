Make initializer lists work with OpenHashMap and OpenHashSet

What more can you do to make OpenHashSet and OpenHashMap drop-in replacements for unordered_set/map

Is any of the following still relevant?

        - copy/move constructors/assignments
    Constructors on everything that take growth/load factor arguments
    Implement COW for mmap'd OpenHashSetTC
    Implement COW for mmap'd OpenHashMapTC
    Implement clone in MMapI2sOpenHashMap
