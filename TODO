Do the following in this order:
- OpenHashSet
- Testing
- Improve constructors
- Exception correctness
- Iterator compatibility/what can you do to make the Maps and Sets closer to being drop-in replacements for unordered_map/unordered_set
- Improve requires clauses, is is_convertible_to really what you want?
- Use optionals or throw, remove print&exit error behavior

template all the methods that take keys use convertible_to in requires
MMapI2HRSOpenHashMap
    - copy/move constructors/assignments
Constructors on everything that take growth/load factor arguments
Create OpenHashSet from OpenHashMap
Fix exception correctness throughout
Remove the exits and return optionals or throw exceptions
